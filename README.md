# Elixir

1. variables，what is assign, why inmutable?
2. function，lambda, parm, body, return value, function call
3. if expression， the pattern match
4. the moudle
5. spwan, process


advise

For this reason, keyword lists are used in Elixir mainly for passing optional values. 
If you need to store many items or guarantee one-key associates with at maximum one-value, 
you should use maps instead.
